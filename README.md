#  Food Wastage Management System from scratch
 
We are aware that a lot of food is thrown away in homes and restaurants, whether it be food that is left on a diner's plate or in the kitchen itself. Most of the food that isn’t used in a restaurant or household is thrown out, but only a small percentage is recycled or donated. Wasting such a large quantity of food is a major problem as the proper quantity of food is not equally distributed to the people.

To overcome this issue, we need to reduce the amount of food we waste by changing the behavior of the people in houses, as well as the chefs at these restaurants, and finding better and smarter ways to divert the food to NGOs.

I am describing a sample database application as Food Wastage Management System. The system keeps track of users, delivery person, orders, and NGO.
